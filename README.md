## ðŸŽ¯ Output Fields Generated

The pipeline generates the following AI-powered classification fields for each lead:

### Core Classification Fields
- **`SPAM_CD`**: Identifies if a lead is legitimate (`VALID`) or spam/junk (`SPAM`)
- **`HARMFUL_CD`**: Flags leads with inappropriate business language (`HARMFUL` / `NOT HARMFUL`)
- **`TITLE_CD`**: Classifies job titles by seniority level:
  - `CXO` - C-level executives and founders
  - `VP+` - Vice Presidents and senior executives
  - `DIRECTOR` - Director level positions
  - `MANAGER` - Managers and team leads
  - `IC` - Individual contributors
  - `JUNK` - Invalid/spam titles

### Company & Lead Quality Fields  
- **`CLEANSED_COMPANY`**: Validated company name or `UNKNOWN` for invalid entries
- **`PRIORITIZE_CD`**: Lead priority scoring based on title and company fit:
  - `HIGH` - Decision makers from target companies
  - `MEDIUM` - Good fit with influence potential
  - `LOW` - Individual contributors from known companies
  - `POOR` - Low alignment with ideal customer profile

### Final Scoring Fields
- **`QUALIFIED_LEAD_CD`**: Overall qualification status (`QUALIFIED` / `NOT QUALIFIED`)
  - Qualified leads must pass all quality checks (not spam, not harmful, valid title, known company, not poor priority)
- **`URGENT_LEAD_CD`**: Urgency flag (`URGENT` / `NOT URGENT`)
  - Urgent leads are qualified leads with CXO-level titles
